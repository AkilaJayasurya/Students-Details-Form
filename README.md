Student Details Form | HTML & JavaScript

I created a Student Details Form using HTML and JavaScript, where users can easily add and delete student information.

ðŸ”¹ Features:

Add student details like Name, Age, Class, etc.

Dynamically display the list of added students

Option to delete any student entry

Clean and simple UI

Fully functional without any backend (pure front-end)

This project is a great example of DOM manipulation and managing dynamic data with JavaScript! ðŸš€
